## Project Overview

The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a fictional company called DriverPass, which provides driving lessons and training packages to customers. The client wanted a web-based system that would allow customers to create accounts, select training packages, schedule driving lessons, make payments, and track their progress. The system also needed to support staff, IT personnel, and owners with administrative functions such as managing accounts, processing payments, generating reports, and maintaining system security. This project focused on gathering business requirements and translating them into a complete system design using UML diagrams and supporting documentation.

## What I Did Well

One area I performed particularly well was translating business requirements into clear and structured system designs. I created UML diagrams that clearly defined system actors, data flow, and interactions between components, ensuring that each user role had well-defined responsibilities. I also did a strong job organizing documentation so that requirements, constraints, and system behavior were easy to understand and trace throughout the design process.

## What I Would Revise

If I could revise one part of my work, I would enhance the level of detail in some of the UML diagrams, particularly by adding more constraints, validation rules, or edge cases. For example, I would expand error-handling paths and include more detailed annotations to further clarify how the system should behave under unexpected conditions. This would make the design even more useful for developers during implementation.

## Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by closely analyzing the interview transcript and identifying both functional and non-functional requirements. These needs were then implemented into the system design through clearly defined use cases, class structures, and workflows. Considering user needs is critical in system design because the system must solve the client’s real problems while remaining usable, secure, and efficient. Ignoring user needs can lead to systems that technically function but fail to deliver value.

## My Approach to Software Design

When designing software, I start by understanding the problem domain and identifying key stakeholders and requirements. I rely on techniques such as use case analysis, UML modeling, and iterative refinement to ensure the system design aligns with user expectations. In the future, I would continue using these strategies while placing even more emphasis on user feedback, risk analysis, and incremental validation to create systems that are both robust and adaptable.
